                Assuming leadership of the <font><a href="#">Indian National Congress</a></font>in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending <font><a href="#"> untouchability</a></font>, and, above all, achieving<a href="#"> swaraj</a> or<a href="#">  self-rule.</a> Gandhi adopted the short <a href="#"> dhoti</a> woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with <a href="#"> India's rural poor.</a> He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both<a href="#">  introspection and political protest</a> Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the <a href="#"> British-imposed</a>  salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the<a href="#">  British</a> to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both<a href="#">South Africa</a> and India.

                Gandhi's vision of an<a href="#">independent India</a> based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a<a href="#">  Muslim nationalism</a> which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India.[12] In August 1947, Britain granted<a href="#">  independence</a>, but the British Indian Empire[12] was partitioned into two dominions, a <a href="#">Hindu-majority India</a> and a Muslim-majority Pakistan.[13] As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the <a href="#">  religious violence</a>. The last of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,[14] also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan.[14] Although the Government of India relented, as did the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, especially those besieged in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a <a href="#"> militant Hindu nationalist</a> from western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.[16] <br>

        <b>Early life and bacckground</b>
        <font size="4" witdh="1"><P>ohandas Karamchand Gandhi[19] was born on 2 October 1869[20] into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family[21][22] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.[23][24] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.[25]

            Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.[26] During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,[26] and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.[27] Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).[28][29]
            
            On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."[30] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he admits that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.[31][32]
            
            The family's religious background was eclectic. Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family.[33][34] Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya.[35] His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible.[34][36] Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who "would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her."[37]
            
            In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security.[38] In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot.[39]</P></font>
